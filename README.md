# Cloney Island Airbnb

![Alt text](https://github.com/Benja-Ross/little_shop/blob/master/app/screen-shots/little_shop_page.png?raw=true "Droids Category Page")

Cloney Island is a greenfield development project with the intention of cloning much of the functionality and design of Airbnb's platform.

Inspired by the most epic twists on Faker Gem data that we could think of, this little ecommerce shop sells potions for superpowers, droids, and vehicles from a galaxy far far away, at great prices too. Visit our site, take a look at some items, effortlessly move starships or a potion of seismic power into your shopping cart. But wait, you don't have much power at all until you sign up for an account. Only then is your fake money good with us. You can also edit your profile, see your past orders, quickly increase the number of each item you wish to purchase. Perhaps you plan to battle the dark side, you're going to need a lot of starships.

The site also has administrative authorization which allows someone with admin status to do everything a normal user can do, but also delete, edit, or create new items.
